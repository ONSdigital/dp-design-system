    <h2 class="mb-4">When to use this component</h2>
    <p>Use the textarea component when you need the user to enter text thatâ€™s longer than one line, for example, to answer an open-ended question.</p>
    <p>A good use of this component is when asking the user for feedback about a service.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="mb-4">When not to use this component</h2>
    <p>Open-ended questions can be difficult for users to answer, so consider breaking down the question into simpler questions that can be answered using a single 
    line input or by selecting an answer using, for example, radios.</p>

<section class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="mb-4">How to use this component</h2>
    <p>All textarea components must have a visible label, with or without a description.</p>
    <p>Textareas should be appropriately sized to help the user understand what they should enter by making them the right size for the content they are intended for.</p>

    <h3 class="mb-4">Use appropriately sized textareas</h3>
    <p>Where possible, you should make the textareas proportional to the amount of text you expect users to enter.</p>
    <p>By default, the textarea component will fill the width of its container and has a default height of 8 lines of text.</p>
